This code creates random lines that all span out from on origin point but the line are ristricted to a square frame. Hence creating a peice of art that looks like a **square star**.

If you want to change the colours you can:
* <h4>In the Proccessing File:</h4>  play with the RGB Range in the Random fuctions in the Fill function:
    * stroke(random(100,255),random(100,255),random(100,255));
